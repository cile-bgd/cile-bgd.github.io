Present financial and non-financial data with descriptive text, informational pop-ups, charts, and graphs. The searching, filtering and sorting tools allow you to find the right information faster and discover information that was once hidden in a spreadsheet. It is a multitenant SPA application hosted on Azure. Backend API is build using CQRS and Repository patterns.

Feature request for the Salaries module of the Questica Budget application. Created 30+ de-normalized snapshot tables and more than 40 stored procedures in order to capture salaries data.

Financial Statements is a module for Questica Budget application that offers the ability to configure and generate financial statements, including Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements. All three statements include both a current statement and the ability to project forward using forecast years. With a new set of accounts for assets, liabilities and equities, this new module helps give a complete picture of your current financials and the road ahead. As a team member, I created entities, screens, menu items, reporting entities, reports, security bits, logging and unit tests for Cash Flow Statement.

#### Order Direct (The Hunt Group)

##### ASP.NET 4.5 • MVC • jQuery • Materialize • Mandrill • Azure Storage • Azure App Service • AzureSQL • GitHub

Order Direct is a Web application created to help our clients with easier customer/employee rewarding with gift cards. Each client can manually enter a single recipient, or they can upload Excel, CSV or XML file with a list of recipients, gift card type, and reward value. They have access to financial reporting, production status and returned or undeliverable shipments. The web application was created in ASP.NET MVC 4.5 (hosted on Azure as App Service) and Azure SQL as a backend database. App uses Azure storage for uploaded files. Admin section is used by THG staff for fulfillment, shipping and client administration. Transactional emails are sent with Mandrill API and front-end uses Materialize library.

#### Tim Hortons & Boston Pizza Custom Gift Cards (The Hunt Group & Buy-A-Tab)

##### ASP.NET 4.5 • MVC • FTP • Azure App Service • AzureSQL • Dapper • SQL Server • GitHub

Completed this project with ASP.NET MVC 4.5 to accommodate client's need for printing, fulfillment, activation and shipping of custom gift cards. The project was divided into several parts: fetching data and custom images, data manipulation for upload to the database, upload of images to the local database accessible by the printer, cards QA, data upload to client’s FTP for activation, fulfillment, shipping and invoicing. Card proxy numbers were pre-loaded in our database. We used Azure App Service for hosting and Azure SQL with Dapper for data. Due to a printer limited networking abilities; we used local SQL Server 2008 for temporary image storage.

Maintained and updated internal Inventory System based on SQL Server 2000 and MS Access. I played a key role in the successful migration of our database from SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2008 and later to SQL Server 2012. In the same process, I completely redesigned front-end GUI built in MS Access to a friendlier user experience using ASP.NET WebForms. During the upgrade, I created and optimized over 200 stored procedures and redesigned over 50 reports. Shipping/receiving tasks are 30% more efficient after adding barcode and QR Code enabled products tracking. In 2012, I converted the whole system from client/server type application to a 100% web-based system with no loss in productivity. In 2014, I upgraded backend to ASP.NET API web service and front end to the ASP.NET MVC app.

It handled the daily upload of about 100K de-normalized CSV records into our on-premise PostgreSQL DB. I created an ETL process for import into staging tables and transform data into appropriate tables. The program would email Rogers IT detailed explanation when it encountered inaccurate data. Designed and developed a various social network and email integration packages using provided APIs from Twitter, Facebook, Google and Mandrill.
